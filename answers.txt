question 1.

leftmost derivation: 
1. Start with Statement:
Statement -> Assignment 

2. Expand Assignment:
Assignment -> Identifier = Expression 
A = Expression 

3. Expand Expression: 
A = Term * Factor 

4. Expand Term on the right side 
A = B * Factor 

5. Expand Factor: 
A = B * (Expression)

6. Expand Expression inside parentheses 
A = B * (Term * Factor)

7.Expand Term in parentheses 
A = B * (C * Factor)

8. Expand Facttor in parantheses 
A = B * (C * (Expression))

9. Expand Expression inside paranthesis 
A = B * (C * (Expression + Term))

10. Expand Expression inside paranthesis 
A = B * (C * (A + Term))

11. Expand Term 
A = B * (C * (A + B))

question 2
a. The answer would be 180 because, u variable is accessed based on its location in the code. The final print does output the value of u 
which is calculated to be 180. 

b. The answer would also be 180 because when foo is called it creates a local v which is set to 42 but the add function accesses the global value
which is 69. which means u = 69 + 42 + 69 which makes it 180 

c. The answer is 42 because when foo is called it sets w to 13. it defines u locally which is 17. which eventually leads to the output of the initial global u which is 42
